StudyBuddy is a Java project I built to help students study more efficiently. It offers two study modes: flashcards and multiple-choice quizzes — the two techniques I personally use the most. The app runs directly in the terminal and gives real-time feedback and scoring. It reads questions and definitions from `.txt` files, and was entirely coded using object-oriented programming in Java. I used classes, interfaces, ArrayLists, and exception handling to make it functional and clean.

## Project Structure

- `StudyBuddy.java`: Main class that runs the app
- `Flashcard.java`: Represents a flashcard
- `Question.java`: Represents a multiple-choice question
- `StudyItem.java`: Interface implemented by both Flashcard and Question
- `FileLoader.java`: Utility to load content from `.txt` files

This is one of my first complete Java applications. I made it simple, user-friendly, and focused on helping others like me study better. You can compile and run it with Java in a few seconds.

Thanks for checking it out!
